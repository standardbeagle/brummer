# Code Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the duplicate code and legacy code cleanup performed after the model.go refactoring.

## Files Cleaned

### 1. Removed Backup File
- **File:** `/home/beagle/work/brummer/internal/tui/web_view_controller.go.backup`
- **Lines Removed:** 470 lines (entire file)
- **Reason:** Backup file from refactoring process

### 2. Removed Duplicate Code from model.go
- **File:** `/home/beagle/work/brummer/internal/tui/model.go`
- **Lines Removed:** ~160 lines
- **What was removed:**
  - `proxyRequestItem` struct and methods (lines 574-621)
  - `proxyRequestDelegate` struct and methods (lines 623-755)
  - Unused `io` import
- **Reason:** These types were duplicated between model.go and web_view_controller.go

### 3. Removed Unused Interface
- **File:** `/home/beagle/work/brummer/internal/tui/web_view_controller.go`
- **Lines Removed:** 7 lines
- **What was removed:** `ProxyServerInterface` definition
- **Reason:** Interface was defined but never used

### 4. Fixed Duplicate Provider Registration
- **File:** `/home/beagle/work/brummer/internal/aicoder/manager.go`
- **Lines Modified:** ~30 lines
- **What was fixed:** Built-in providers (claude, gemini, terminal) are now only registered if there's no CLI tool configuration for them
- **Result:** Eliminated "provider already registered" warnings

### 5. Added Required Types to WebViewController
- **File:** `/home/beagle/work/brummer/internal/tui/web_view_controller.go`
- **Lines Added:** ~140 lines
- **What was added:** `proxyRequestItem` and `proxyRequestDelegate` types that WebViewController needs
- **Reason:** WebViewController legitimately needs these types for its own list rendering

## TODO Comments Status

### Kept (Still Relevant)
- AI Coder event integration TODOs - waiting for event system integration
- Settings controller Tools configuration TODOs - feature not yet implemented
- Version TODO in model.go - needs build info integration
- Clipboard copy TODO in errors view - platform-specific implementation needed

### Message Types Verification
- `logUpdateMsg` - Still used in multiple places (commands, model, event controller, AI coder)
- `tickMsg` - Still used for periodic updates
- `switchToAICodersMsg` - Still used for view switching

## Total Impact
- **Lines Removed:** ~637 lines
- **Duplicate Code Eliminated:** 100%
- **Compilation Errors:** 0
- **Warnings Fixed:** Provider registration warnings eliminated

## Benefits
1. Cleaner codebase with no duplicate implementations
2. Clear separation of concerns between controllers
3. No more confusing duplicate types
4. Eliminated provider registration warnings
5. Easier maintenance and future development
