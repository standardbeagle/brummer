# Test Management Feature Summary

## Overview

The Test Management System is the **highest priority feature** in Brummer's roadmap, designed to provide comprehensive testing capabilities with minimal context bloat for AI agents.

## Key Design Goals

### 1. Minimal Context for Success ✅
```
✅ 23 tests passed (1.2s)
```
- Single line for all passing tests
- No detailed output cluttering AI context
- Only timing and count information

### 2. Rich Context for Failures ❌
```
❌ user/profile_test.go (line 23)
Expected: "john@example.com"
Actual:   ""
Stack: TestUserProfile -> validateEmail -> isEmpty
```
- Complete error information
- File locations and line numbers
- Stack traces and failure context
- Suggested fixes when possible

### 3. Agent-Optimized Events 🤖
- Automatic notifications on test failures
- Context-aware filtering (only tests related to recent changes)
- Smart relevance scoring for AI agents

## User Interface

### TUI Test Tab
- **Hotkey**: `t` to switch to test view
- **Run Tests**: `r` for all tests, `R` for pattern-based
- **Watch Mode**: `w` for continuous testing
- **Results View**: Progressive disclosure (summary → details)

### Key Features
- **Real-time Results**: Live updates during test execution
- **Coverage Integration**: Optional code coverage display
- **Framework Detection**: Automatic test runner detection
- **Multi-language Support**: Jest, Go test, pytest, and more

## MCP Integration

### Core Tools
```yaml
test_run:     # Execute tests with filtering
test_status:  # Get current test status
test_failures: # Get detailed failure info
test_coverage: # Code coverage data
test_watch:   # Control watch mode
test_clear:   # Clear test history
```

### AI-Optimized Responses
- **Passing Tests**: Minimal JSON with counts only
- **Failing Tests**: Rich context with error details
- **Smart Filtering**: Only relevant tests for recent changes

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```
/internal/testing/
├── manager.go    # Test orchestration
├── runner.go     # Framework-specific runners
├── parser.go     # Output parsing
├── watcher.go    # File system watching
└── results.go    # Result storage

/internal/tui/
└── test_view.go  # TUI interface

/internal/mcp/
└── test_tools.go # MCP tools
```

### Framework Support
- **JavaScript**: Jest, Vitest, Mocha, Playwright
- **Go**: go test, testify, ginkgo
- **Python**: pytest, unittest
- **Rust**: cargo test, criterion

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1A: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Test runner interface and manager
- [ ] Basic framework detection (Jest, Go test)
- [ ] Test result parsing and storage
- [ ] MCP tools foundation

### Phase 1B: TUI Integration (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Test view implementation
- [ ] Hotkey bindings and navigation
- [ ] Real-time result display
- [ ] Progressive disclosure UI

### Phase 1C: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Watch mode implementation
- [ ] Coverage integration
- [ ] Additional framework support
- [ ] AI event optimization

## Success Metrics

### Developer Experience
- **Test Feedback Time**: < 5 seconds for simple tests
- **Context Switching**: Minimal tool switching during development
- **Coverage Visibility**: Easy access to coverage data

### AI Agent Effectiveness
- **Context Efficiency**: 90% reduction in irrelevant test output
- **Failure Resolution**: AI can resolve 70% of test failures with provided context
- **Smart Filtering**: Only show tests related to recent file changes

### System Performance
- **Response Time**: Sub-second UI updates
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient result storage and cleanup
- **Watch Mode**: Responsive file change detection

## Configuration

### Test Settings
```toml
[testing]
timeout = "5m"
max_history = 100
default_coverage = false
watch_debounce = "500ms"

[testing.jest]
coverage_threshold = 80
parallel = true

[testing.go]
race_detection = true
coverage_profile = "coverage.out"
```

## Future Enhancements

### AI-Powered Features (Phase 1D)
- **Intelligent Test Generation**: Generate tests from code analysis
- **Flaky Test Detection**: Identify unreliable tests
- **Performance Regression Detection**: Alert on timing changes
- **Smart Test Selection**: Run only tests likely to fail

### Advanced Integrations (Later Phases)
- **CI/CD Integration**: Import remote test results
- **Code Review Integration**: Show test status in PRs
- **Team Dashboards**: Aggregate metrics across developers

## Getting Started

Once implemented, users will:

1. **Press `t`** to switch to test view
2. **Press `r`** to run tests
3. **See minimal output** for passing tests
4. **Get rich context** for any failures
5. **Use `w`** for continuous testing during development

The system will automatically detect test frameworks and provide intelligent defaults, making it zero-configuration for most projects.

## Impact on Development Workflow

### Before Test Management
- Manual test execution in separate terminals
- Context switching between tools
- Verbose output cluttering AI conversations
- No integrated coverage visibility

### After Test Management
- One-key test execution within Brummer
- Minimal context for AI agents (passing tests)
- Rich debugging info when needed (failing tests)
- Integrated coverage and watch mode
- Smart test selection based on file changes

This feature represents a significant step toward making Brummer a comprehensive development environment that minimizes context bloat while maximizing debugging effectiveness.
