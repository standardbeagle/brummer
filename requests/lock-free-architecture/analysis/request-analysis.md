# Master Request Analysis - Lock-Free Architecture
**Original Request**: Complete analysis of script, log, and error tools for race conditions and create a plan to reduce locking using channels and goroutines
**Business Context**: Developer experiencing lockups with `scripts_status` MCP tool, needs more robust debugging application
**Success Definition**: Simpler, more maintainable code with fewer lockup risks, even if performance is lower
**Project Phase**: Refactoring/Architecture Improvement
**Timeline Constraints**: None specified - focus on correctness over speed
**Integration Scope**: MCP tools, Process Manager, Log Store, Proxy Server, TUI components

## Critical Assumptions Identification
**Technical Assumptions**: 
- Channels provide simpler coordination than mutexes for low-volume debugging workload ✓
- Single goroutine per subsystem is sufficient for coordination ✓
- Integration tests can be added incrementally as refactoring progresses ✓

**Business Assumptions**: 
- Performance can be sacrificed for simplicity and maintainability ✓
- Users value reliability over speed for debugging tools ✓
- Features can be temporarily removed and re-added later ✓

**Architecture Assumptions**: 
- Current event bus can handle channel-based architecture ✓
- Internal APIs can be freely modified for simplicity ✓
- Debug/inspection tooling can be built alongside refactoring ✓

**Resource Assumptions**: 
- Time available for careful, incremental refactoring ✓
- No pressure for immediate performance gains ✓
- Developer time for building test infrastructure ✓

**Integration Assumptions**: 
- MCP tools can be refactored one at a time ✓
- TUI can adapt to new event-driven updates ✓
- Existing tests won't block API changes ✓

## Assumption Risk Assessment
**High-Risk Assumptions**: None - focusing on simplicity reduces architectural risks
**Medium-Risk Assumptions**: Integration test coverage may reveal hidden dependencies
**Low-Risk Assumptions**: All other assumptions validated by simplicity-first approach
