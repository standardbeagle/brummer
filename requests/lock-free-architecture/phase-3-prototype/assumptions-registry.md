# Phase 3: Channel-based Process Manager - Critical Assumptions Registry

**Created**: January 31, 2025  
**Phase**: Lock-Free Architecture - Phase 3  
**Focus**: Channel-based Process Manager Refactoring  
**Method**: Prototype-First Execution

## Critical Assumptions to Test

### 1. Performance Assumptions

#### Assumption 1.1: Channel Performance
**Statement**: "Channels will provide better performance than mutexes for process state management"
- **Risk**: HIGH - Core assumption driving entire refactoring
- **Test Method**: Benchmark channel vs mutex for typical operations
- **Success Criteria**: >20% performance improvement in concurrent scenarios
- **Prototype**: `proto-channel-perf` worktree

#### Assumption 1.2: Memory Overhead
**Statement**: "Channel-based approach won't significantly increase memory usage"
- **Risk**: MEDIUM - Could impact resource-constrained environments
- **Test Method**: Memory profiling of channel vs mutex approaches
- **Success Criteria**: <10% memory increase over current implementation
- **Prototype**: `proto-memory-profile` worktree

### 2. Integration Complexity Assumptions

#### Assumption 2.1: API Compatibility
**Statement**: "Existing API can be maintained while using channels internally"
- **Risk**: HIGH - Breaking changes would impact all consumers
- **Test Method**: Implement adapter layer maintaining current interface
- **Success Criteria**: 100% backward compatibility with existing tests
- **Prototype**: `proto-api-adapter` worktree

#### Assumption 2.2: Event System Integration
**Statement**: "Current event bus can efficiently work with channel-based processes"
- **Risk**: MEDIUM - May require event system refactoring
- **Test Method**: Test event delivery with channel-based state changes
- **Success Criteria**: No event loss, <5ms additional latency
- **Prototype**: `proto-event-integration` worktree

### 3. Concurrency Pattern Assumptions

#### Assumption 3.1: State Machine Viability
**Statement**: "Process lifecycle can be modeled as channel-driven state machine"
- **Risk**: MEDIUM - Complex state transitions may be difficult
- **Test Method**: Implement state machine for all process states
- **Success Criteria**: All state transitions correctly handled
- **Prototype**: `proto-state-machine` worktree

#### Assumption 3.2: Deadlock Prevention
**Statement**: "Channel-based approach will reduce deadlock risk"
- **Risk**: HIGH - Could introduce new deadlock scenarios
- **Test Method**: Stress test with concurrent operations
- **Success Criteria**: Zero deadlocks in 1M operation test
- **Prototype**: `proto-deadlock-test` worktree

### 4. Operational Assumptions

#### Assumption 4.1: Graceful Shutdown
**Statement**: "Channel cleanup during shutdown will be reliable"
- **Risk**: HIGH - Resource leaks could impact production
- **Test Method**: Test shutdown under various load conditions
- **Success Criteria**: Clean shutdown in <100ms, no goroutine leaks
- **Prototype**: `proto-shutdown` worktree

#### Assumption 4.2: Error Propagation
**Statement**: "Errors can be effectively propagated through channels"
- **Risk**: MEDIUM - Error handling complexity could increase
- **Test Method**: Test error scenarios with channel communication
- **Success Criteria**: All errors properly handled and logged
- **Prototype**: `proto-error-handling` worktree

## Testing Priority Matrix

| Assumption | Risk | Impact | Priority | First Test |
|------------|------|--------|----------|------------|
| 1.1 Channel Performance | HIGH | HIGH | P0 | Immediate |
| 2.1 API Compatibility | HIGH | HIGH | P0 | Immediate |
| 3.2 Deadlock Prevention | HIGH | HIGH | P0 | Immediate |
| 4.1 Graceful Shutdown | HIGH | HIGH | P0 | Week 1 |
| 1.2 Memory Overhead | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | P1 | Week 1 |
| 2.2 Event Integration | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | P1 | Week 2 |
| 3.1 State Machine | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | P1 | Week 2 |
| 4.2 Error Propagation | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | P1 | Week 2 |

## Prototype Testing Plan

### Week 1: Core Viability Testing
1. **Day 1-2**: Set up prototype worktrees and baseline benchmarks
2. **Day 3-4**: Test Assumption 1.1 (Channel Performance)
3. **Day 5**: Test Assumption 2.1 (API Compatibility)

### Week 2: Risk Mitigation Testing
1. **Day 1-2**: Test Assumption 3.2 (Deadlock Prevention)
2. **Day 3-4**: Test Assumption 4.1 (Graceful Shutdown)
3. **Day 5**: Analyze results and decide on full implementation

## Success/Failure Criteria

### Go Decision Requires:
- ALL P0 assumptions validated
- At least 75% of P1 assumptions validated
- Clear migration path identified
- Performance improvement demonstrated

### No-Go Triggers:
- Any HIGH risk assumption fails validation
- Performance regression detected
- API compatibility cannot be maintained
- Deadlock risks increase

## Baseline Metrics (Current Mutex Implementation)

From Phase 2 benchmarks:
- Process status check: 23.11 ns/op (with ProcessSnapshot)
- Concurrent access (10 goroutines): 5953 ns/op
- High contention (50 readers): 352.1 ns/op
- Memory allocation: 0 allocs per operation
- Deadlock incidents: 0 (with current getter methods)

## Next Steps

1. Create prototype worktrees for each assumption test
2. Implement minimal channel-based process manager in first prototype
3. Run performance comparison benchmarks
4. Document findings in assumption validation reports
5. Make go/no-go decision based on empirical evidence

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### If Performance Assumption Fails:
- Consider hybrid approach (channels for some operations, mutexes for others)
- Investigate alternative lock-free structures (atomic operations, CAS)
- Profile to identify specific bottlenecks

### If API Compatibility Fails:
- Design migration strategy with deprecation period
- Provide compatibility layer for gradual migration
- Consider versioned API approach

### If Deadlock Risk Increases:
- Implement deadlock detection tooling
- Design channel architecture to prevent circular dependencies
- Use timeouts and context cancellation patterns

This registry will be updated with test results as each assumption is validated or invalidated.
