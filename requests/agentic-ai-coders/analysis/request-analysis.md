# Master Request Analysis: Agentic AI Coders in TUI

## Original Request
**User Request**: "plan out being able to launch and run agentic ai coders in a tab in the tui"

## Business Context Analysis
**Why This Feature is Needed**:
- Brummer is a development environment orchestration tool with TUI interface
- Current TUI supports process management, logs, and browser automation
- Adding AI coders would enable developers to launch autonomous coding agents within their development workflow
- This extends Brummer from process orchestration to intelligent development assistance
- Fits with the existing MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for AI tool access

## Success Definition
**Feature Complete When**:
- [ ] New TUI tab/view for AI coder management
- [ ] Can launch multiple AI coder instances
- [ ] Each coder has isolated workspace and context
- [ ] Integration with existing MCP infrastructure
- [ ] Visual status monitoring and control
- [ ] Proper resource management and cleanup

## Project Phase Assessment
**Current Brummer Maturity**: Production-ready process manager with MCP integration
**Feature Complexity**: HIGH - Multiple new subsystems required
**Integration Scope**: Cross-system (TUI, MCP, Process Management, File System)

## Timeline Constraints
**Development Complexity**: 20-30 hours estimated
**Integration Risk**: HIGH - requires coordination across multiple existing systems
**User Priority**: Development productivity enhancement

## Integration Scope Analysis
**Systems Affected**:
- TUI system (new views and tab management)
- MCP server infrastructure (new tools and capabilities)
- Process management system (AI coder lifecycle)
- File system management (workspace isolation)
- Configuration system (AI coder settings)
- Event system (status updates and communication)

## Feature Architecture Overview
**Core Components**:
1. **AI Coder Management Service** - Launch, monitor, and control AI coder instances
2. **TUI Integration** - New tab/view for AI coder interface
3. **Workspace Isolation** - File system sandboxing for AI coder operations
4. **MCP Tool Extensions** - New MCP tools for AI coder interaction
5. **Status Monitoring** - Real-time visibility into AI coder activities
6. **Resource Management** - Memory, CPU, and file system quotas

## Risk Assessment
**High Risks**:
- AI coder integration complexity
- Resource management and isolation
- TUI architecture modifications
- MCP tool coordination

**Medium Risks**:
- User experience design
- Configuration management
- Error handling and recovery

**Low Risks**:
- Basic process lifecycle management
- Logging and monitoring integration
