## Current State Assessment
**Before starting this task:**
```yaml
existing_state:
  - ✅ Initial race condition report completed with static analysis
  - ✅ Basic go vet output shows 60+ value copy warnings
  - ✅ Failed race detector tests identified performance issues
  - ❌ Detailed analysis of lock-free alternatives not completed

  - internal/logs/store.go: Has mixed async/sync operations
  - internal/proxy/server.go: Has multiple mutex anti-pattern
```

## Task Requirements
- **Objective**: Create comprehensive analysis of race conditions and research optimal solutions
- **Risk Level**: LOW (Research only, no code changes)
- **Dependencies**: None (foundational research)
- **Deliverables**: 
  - Detailed concurrency best practices document
  - Worker pool sizing recommendations
  - Lock-free alternative analysis
  - Performance impact assessment
  - Tool recommendations for ongoing race detection

## Success Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Document Go concurrency best practices with code examples
- [ ] Research optimal worker pool sizing for EventBus (CPU cores * N factor)
- [ ] Analyze lock-free alternatives to current mutex usage
- [ ] Estimate performance impact of proposed synchronization changes
- [ ] Document race detection tools and CI integration options
- [ ] Create benchmark baseline for critical code paths
- [ ] Research goroutine leak detection and prevention
- [ ] Document deadlock prevention patterns

## Risk Mitigation
- **Spike Tasks**: No implementation required, pure research
- **Validation Steps**: Validate recommendations against current codebase
- **Progressive Research**: Start with critical issues, expand to optimizations

## Success Validation
```bash
# Verify research documents created
ls -la requests/race-condition-fixes/research/
# Expected: 5 research documents

# Check document completeness
wc -l requests/race-condition-fixes/research/*.md
# Expected: Substantial content in each document (>100 lines each)

# Validate recommendations against codebase
grep -r "sync\." --include="*.go" | wc -l
# Count current synchronization usage for baseline
```
