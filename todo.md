## Gotchas & Considerations
- **Known Issues**: 
  - BubbleTea interface compliance requires careful pointer receiver implementation
  - Worker pool sizing affects memory usage and performance
  - Lock ordering must be consistent across all components to prevent deadlocks
  - Test coverage gap (3.8%) insufficient for race condition validation

- **Edge Cases**: 
  - TUI shutdown during process cleanup requires graceful handling
  - EventBus overload scenarios need fallback to synchronous processing
  - Process Manager startup/shutdown race conditions during system boot
  - MCP session cleanup during connection failures

- **Performance**: 
  - Expected 5-10% overhead from synchronization primitives
  - Memory usage increase from bounded worker pools and channels
  - Potential latency increase in high-concurrency scenarios

- **Backwards Compatibility**: 
  - TUI interface changes are internal - no external API impact
  - Configuration may require new options for worker pool sizing
  - Build commands updated for race detection in CI

- **Security**: 
  - Race conditions eliminated prevent timing attack vulnerabilities
  - Proper synchronization prevents data corruption security issues
  - Resource exhaustion prevention through bounded goroutine pools
