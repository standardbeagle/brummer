# Browser Extension Features

The Brummer browser extension enhances your debugging experience by providing real-time integration between your browser and the Brummer TUI.

## Core Features

### üîó Automatic URL Detection

The extension automatically detects and highlights URLs from your development servers:

- **Localhost URLs**: `http://localhost:3000`, `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
- **Network URLs**: `http://192.168.1.100:3000`
- **Custom domains**: Any configured development domains

When Brummer detects a URL in your logs, the extension:
1. Adds a visual indicator in the browser
2. Shows which process is serving the URL
3. Displays the current status (running, building, error)

### üìä Real-time Status Monitoring

See the status of your development servers directly in the browser:

- **Green indicator**: Server is running normally
- **Yellow indicator**: Build in progress
- **Red indicator**: Server error or crash
- **Gray indicator**: Server stopped

### üêõ Error Overlay

When errors occur in your development server:

1. **Non-intrusive notification** appears in the browser
2. **Click to expand** full error details
3. **Direct link** to the error location in your code
4. **Copy error** to clipboard for debugging

### üîÑ Auto-refresh on Build

The extension can automatically refresh your page when:
- Build completes successfully
